# AcidIsland
AcidIsland add-on for BentoBox.

## The Story
You're on an island, in a sea of acid! If you like Skyblock, try AcidIsland for a new challenge!

This is a variation of SkyBlock. Instead of falling, you must contend with acid water when expanding your island and players can boat to each other's islands.

## Installing

1. Place this jar into the addon folder of the BentoBox plugin.
2. Reload/restart the server
3. Adjust the config.yml how you like
